Within this code, you will see a series of questions as well as templates for commands that were to
be explored in this exercise. Underneathe each template, there is either a question, a space to comment,
or both. the space to comment indicated by a '#' symbol or a comment in (''' ''') are where my answers lie
to each scenario. The goal of this program is familiarize myself with the commands and syntax used in the
Python language. The skills taught in this exercises included basic mathematic operations such as addition
and multiplication as well as exponents. Other commands included how strings worked in Python and various
commands surrounding strings and different ways to think about strings and string commands. Another large
topic was random number generation including several ways how to call up random numbers within a set range.
Each problem came with its own set of directions that included copying the code into an IDLE and running
the code to see what the result was and then copying the results in the comment spaces of the code.
That is ultimately what this program is, a teaching tool to familiarize myself with the commands and 
my discoveries are included in the comment spaces.
